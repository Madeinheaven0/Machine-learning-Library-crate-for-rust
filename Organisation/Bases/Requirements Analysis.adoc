. Would have:Polynomial regressor
. Won't have: SVM regressor

==== Classification
. Must have: Logistic Regression
. Should have: Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Boosting, Stacking, Gradient Boosting
. Would have: KNN Regressor
. Won't have: SVM Classifier

==== Clustering
. Must have: K-Mean Clustering
. Should have: Isolation Forest
. Would have: DBSCAN
. Won't have: Kernel Density

=== Metrics

==== Classification
. Must have: Accuracy, F1-score, Sensibility, Precision, Confusion Matrice
. should have:
. Would have: Specificity
. Won't have: ROC-AUR, AUC-PR

=== Regression
. Must have: MSE, RMSE, MAE
. Should have: MSLE
. Would have: MAPE, R2
. Won't have: SMAPE, Adjusted R2

== Use case

=== Story
 As a user, I would want to create a classification or regressor models to solve several types of problems.
 After my model trained, I would use different metrics to evaluate my model either is a classification or a regression model.

=== Technical tasks
* Create a model
* Fit it with train data
* Select loss function
* Select different metrics
* Use it to the model with the test data
* Plot the result
